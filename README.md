# HR-Employees-Analysis-Dashboard-Project

##ðŸ§  Employee HR Analytics Dashboard â€” Power BI Project

This is an interactive and insight-driven HR Analytics Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. The goal of this dashboard is to explore workforce data and uncover key trends around attrition, compensation, department structure, and employee demographics.

I created this project with a practical business use case in mind â€” helping HR managers and leadership make quick, data-driven decisions.
